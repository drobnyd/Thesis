% \section[Introduction]{Introduction}
%
% This package\footnote{An earlier version of this documentation 
% was published as \cite{pdfx}. All the changes since then have been developed
% and coded by the 3rd-listed author.}
% currently supports generation of PDF/X-, PDF/A- and PDF/E-compliant 
% documents,  using \pdftex, in most of their variants;
% see the complete list in Section~\ref{ssec-options} below.
% As of \TeX\,Live 2016 it now also works with Lua\LaTeX\ and Xe\LaTeX,
% when using appropriate command-line options\footnote{%
% The required invokation is:\quad
%  |xelatex --shell-escape   -output-driver="xdvipdfmx -z 0" <filename>.tex |}, but
% with some limitations --- see Sections~\ref{sssec-xetex} and \ref{sssec-luatex}.
% By `supports', we mean that the package provides correct and sufficient  
% means to declare that a document conforms with a stated PDF variant
% (PDF/X, PDF/A, PDF/E, PDF/VT, PDF/UA, etc.) along with the version and/or 
% level of conformance.
% This package also allows appropriate Metadata and Color Profile
% to be specified, according to the requirements of the PDF variant.
%
% Metadata elements, most of which must ultimately be written as XML
% using the UTF-8 encoding, is provided via a file named |\jobname.xmpdata|,
% for the running \LaTeX\ job. Without such a file, providing some required
% information as well as a large range of optional data, a fully validating
% PDF file cannot be achieved. The PDF can be created, having the correct
% visual appearance on all pages, but it will not pass validation checks.
% Sections~\ref{ssec-metadata} and \ref{ssec-multi} describe 
% how this file should be constructed.
%
% \medskip
% What this package \emph{does not do} is to check for all the details
% of document structure and type of content that may be required
% (or restricted) within a PDF variant. For example, PDF/VT \cite{PDFVT} requires
% well-structured parts, using Form XObject sections tagged as `/DPart'.
% Similarly PDF/A-1a (and 2a and 3a) \cite{PDFA,PDFA2,PDFA3} require  
% a fully `Tagged PDF', including a detailed structure tagging which  
% envelops the complete contents of the document, as does also PDF/UA \cite{PDF-UA}.
% This is beyond the current version of \LaTeX\ engines, as commonly shipped.
% So while this package provides enough to meet the declaration,
% metadata and font-handling aspects for these PDF/A variants, 
% it is not sufficient to produce fully conforming PDFs. 
% However, with extra \pdftex-based software or macro coding that \emph{is} capable 
% of producing `Tagged PDF', this package can be used as part of 
% the overall workflow to produce fully conforming documents.
%
%
% \subsection{PDF standards}\label{ssec-standards}
%
% PDF/X and PDF/A are umbrella terms used to denote several ISO
% standards \cite{PDFX,PDFX3,PDFX1a,PDFX4,PDFX5,PDFA,PDFA2,PDFA3} 
% that define different subsets of the PDF standard \cite{PDF17,ISO32000}. 
% The objective of PDF/X is to facilitate graphics exchange between
% document creator and printer and therefore, has all requirements
% related to printing. For instance, in PDF/X, all fonts need to be
% embedded and all images need to be CMYK or spot colors. PDF/X-2 and
% PDF/X-3 accept calibrated RGB and CIELAB colors along with all other
% specifications of PDF/X.
% Since 2005 other variants of PDF/X have emerged, as extra effects
% (such as layering and transparency) have been supported within the PDF
% standard itself. The full range of versions and conformance supported 
% in this package is discussed below in Section~\ref{ssec-options}.
%
% PDF/A defines a profile for archiving PDF documents, which ensures
% the documents can be reproduced in the exact same way in years to
% come. A key element to achieving this is that PDF/A documents
% are 100\% self-contained.  All the information needed to display the
% document in the same manner every time is embedded in the file. 
% A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from
% external sources.  Other restrictions include avoidance of
% audio/video content, JavaScript and encryption.  
% Mandatory inclusion of fonts, color profile and standards-based metadata 
% are absolutely essential for PDF/A.
% Later versions allow for use of image compression and file attachments.
%
% PDF/E is an ISO standard \cite{PDFE} intended for documents used in engineering workflows. 
% PDF/VT \cite{PDFVT} allows for high-volume customised form printing, such as utility bills.
% PDF/UA (`Universal Accessibility') has emerged as a standard \cite{PDF-UA,PDFUA1,PDFUABSI}
% supporting Assistive Technologies, incorporating web-accessibility guidelines (WCAG) 
% for electronic documents. 
% In future, PDF/H may emerge for health records and medical-related
% documents. Other applications can be envisaged. 
% Declarations and Metadata are supported for the first three of these.
% The others are the subject of further work; revised versions of this
% package can be expected in later years.
%
% More complete descriptions of these standards and their usage can be
% found on Wikipedia pages~\cite{wikiPDF}. These pages also include
% comprehensive links to web resources, guides, commentaries, discussions
% and whatever else is relevant to how the standards have been established
% and how they can be used.
%
% \section[Usage]{Usage}\label{sec-usage}
%
% The package can be loaded with the command:
% \begin{decl}
% \defmacro{usepackage}|[<option>]{pdfx}|
% \end{decl}
% where the options are as follows.
%
% \subsection{Package options}\label{ssec-options}
%
% \subsubsection{PDF/A options}
% 
% PDF/A is an ISO standard~\cite{PDFA,PDFA2,PDFA3} intended for long-term archiving of
% electronic documents. It therefore emphasizes self-containedness and
% reproducibility, as well as machine-readable metadata.  The PDF/A
% standard has three conformance levels `a', `b', and `u'. Level
% `a' is the strictest, but is not yet fully implemented by the
% |pdfx| package. Conformance level `u' has the same requirements as
% level `b', but with the additional requirement that all text in
% the document must have a Unicode mapping. However, the |pdfx|
% package produces such Unicode mappings even in level `b' files.
% The standard also has three different versions 1, 2, and 3, which
% were standardized in 2005, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  Earlier
% versions contain a subset of the features of later versions, so for
% maximum portability, it is preferable to use a lower-numbered
% version, when the extra features allowed in higher versions are not used.
% There is no conformance level `u' in version 1 of the standard.  
% Thus for many typical uses of PDF/A, it is sufficient to use PDF/A-1b.
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |a-1a|: generate PDF/A-1a. Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \item |a-1b|: generate PDF/A-1b.
% \item |a-2a|: generate PDF/A-2a. Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \item |a-2b|: generate PDF/A-2b.
% \item |a-2u|: generate PDF/A-2u.
% \item |a-3a|: generate PDF/A-3a. Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \item |a-3b|: generate PDF/A-3b.
% \item |a-3u|: generate PDF/A-3u.
% \end{itemize}
% By `Experimental, not fully implemented' here we mean primarily that 
% the document structure, as required for `Tagged PDF', is not handled
% by this package. Using other \pdftex-based software that \emph{is} 
% capable of producing such complete tagging, conforming documents
% can indeed be produced.
%
% \subsubsection{PDF/E options}
% 
% PDF/E is an ISO standard~\cite{PDFE} intended for documents used in engineering
% workflows. There is only one version of the PDF/E standard so far,
% and it is called PDF/E-1.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |e-1|: generate PDF/E-1.
% \item |e|: same as |e-1|.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{PDF/UA options}
% 
% PDF/UA is an ISO and ANSI standard~\cite{PDF-UA,PDFUABSI} intended for making 
% structured documents readable and navigable using Assistive Technology; 
% e.g., screen-readers, Braille keyboards and such-like. 
% Documents prepared this way can be easily saved in other formats which
% preserve the structure, such as XML, HTML, and (Microsoft) Word-based formats.
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |ua-1|: generate PDF/UA-1.
% \item |ua|: same as |ua-1|.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{PDF/VT options}
%
% PDF/VT is an ISO standard intended as an exchange format for
% variable and transactional printing, and is an extension of the
% PDF/X-4 standard. The standard specifies three PDF/VT conformance
% levels. Level 1 is for single-file exchange, level 2 is for
% multi-file exchange, and level 2s is for streamed delivery.
% Currently, none of the PDF/VT conformance levels are fully
% implemented by the |pdfx| package.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |vt-1|: generate PDF/VT-1, based on PDF/X-4. Experimental, not fully implemented
% \item |vt-2|: generate PDF/VT-2, based on PDF/X-5pg. Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \item |vt-2s|: generate PDF/VT-2s. Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \end{itemize}
% By `Experimental, not fully implemented' here we mean primarily that 
% the structuring of a document into `/DPart' sections, as Form XObjects,
% is not handled by this package. 
% This \emph{is} possible with current \pdftex\ software, 
% but not yet in a way that lends itself easily to full automation, due to
% requirements of knowing the internal object number of certain internal
% PDF constructs. All the other aspects: PDFInfo declaration, Metadata 
% and Color Profile, of the PDF/VT variants are correctly handled. 
%
% \subsubsection{PDF/X options}
%
% PDF/X is an ISO standard intended for graphics interchange. It
% emphasizes printing-related requirements, such as embedded fonts and
% color profiles. The PDF/X standard has a large number of variants
% and conformance levels. The basic variants are X-1, X-1a,
% X-3, X-4, and X-5. (Note that a revised version of the X-2 standard 
% was published in 2003 but withdrawn as an ISO standard in 2011, 
% basically due to lack of interest in using it). 
% The PDF/X-1a standard exists in revisions of 2001 and 2003, 
% the PDF/X-3 standard exists in revisions of 2002 and 2003, 
% and the PDF/X-4 and PDF/X-5 standards exist in revisions of 2008 and 2010. 
% Moreover, some of these standards have a `p' version, which permits the 
% use of an externally supplied color profile (instead of an embedded one),
% and/or a `g' version, which permits the use of external graphical
% content. Moreover, PDF/X-5 has an `n' version, which extends
% PDF/X-4p by permitting additional `Custom' color spaces other than Grayscale,
% RGB, and CMYK. For many typical uses of PDF/X, it is sufficient to
% use PDF/X-1a.
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |x-1|:    generate PDF/X-1; now obsolete, doesn't validate.
% \item |x-1a|:   generate PDF/X-1a. Options |x-1a1| and |x-1a3| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-1a:2001 or PDF/X-1a:2003 explicitly.
% \item |x-2|:    generate PDF/X-2; unpublished, doesn't validate.
% \item |x-3|:    generate PDF/X-3. Options |x-302| and |x-303| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-3:2002 or PDF/X-3:2003 explicitly.
% \item |x-4|:    generate PDF/X-4. Options |x-408| and |x-410| are            
% also available to specify PDF/X-4:2008 or PDF/X-4:2010 explicitly.
% \item |x-4p|:   generate PDF/X-4p. Options |x-4p08| and |x-4p10| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-4p:2008 or PDF/X-4p:2010 explicitly.
% \item |x-5g|:   generate PDF/X-5g. Options |x-5g08| and |x-5g10| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-5g:2008 or PDF/X-5g:2010 explicitly.
% \item |x-5n|:   generate PDF/X-5n. Options |x-5n08| and |x-5n10| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-5n:2008 or PDF/X-5n:2010 explicitly. 
% Experimental, not fully implemented.
% \item |x-5pg|:  generate PDF/X-5pg. Options |x-5pg08| and |x-5pg10| are
% also available to specify PDF/X-5pg:2008 or PDF/X-5pg:2010 explicitly.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{Other options}
%
% These options are experimental and should not normally be used.
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |useBOM|: generate an explicit UTF-8 byte-order marker in the
%   embedded XMP metadata, and make the XMP packet writable. Neither
%   of these features are required by the PDF/A standard, but there
%   exist some PDF/A validators (reportedly |validatepdfa.com|) that
%   seem to require them. Note: the implementation of this feature is
%   experimental and may break with future updates to the |xmpincl|
%   package.
% \item |noBOM|: do not generate the optional byte-order marker. (default)
% \item |noerr|: avoids stopping when making PDF/X with an RGB profile,
%  and at other unusual situations; e.g., PDF/UA without also PDF/A.
% \item |pdf12|: use PDF 1.2, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \item |pdf13|: use PDF 1.3, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \item |pdf14|: use PDF 1.4, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \item |pdf15|: use PDF 1.5, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \item |pdf16|: use PDF 1.6, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \item |pdf17|: use PDF 1.7, overriding the version specified by the
% applicable standard.\\This may produce a non-standard-conforming PDF file.
% \end{itemize} 
%
% \subsubsection{XMP language options}\label{ssec-xmplang}
%
% These options allow for characters in alphabets other than those  
% used for English and Western European languages to be used 
% within the |.xmpdata| file (see Section~\ref{ssec-metadata}), 
% supported through \LaTeX\ character representation macros.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |latxmp|: extended Latin blocks, |Ux0180|--|Ux024F| 
%    and |Ux1E00|--|Ux1EFF| 
% \item |armxmp|: armenian letters and ligatures, |Ux0530|--|Ux058F|,

% \end{itemize}
% The characters supported by these options include those supported
% by |hyperref.sty| via the |PDFdoc| encodings (|PD1| and |PU|)
% for inclusion in PDF files. Extra support is provided for math
% alphabets. For Armenian, the macros defined by Arm\TeX\ are supported.
%
% \medskip
% Further options allow direct (enclosed) input of upper 8-bit
% characters, from encodings such as Latin-1--Latin-9, KOI8-R,
% LGR (Greek), ArmSSCI8, and a few more.
% Use of these requires a carefully controlled parsing regime. 
% Here we list the package options that declare such content
% may be present in the |.xmpdata| file.
% A detailed account of how these are used is given 
% in~Section~\ref{ssec-multi} (``Multilingual Metadata'').
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |LATxmp|: support for direct use of the upper-range characters 
%  (byte codes 160--255) for input encodings Latin1--Latin9, for
%  Latin-based alphabets as used in European countries and elsewhere.
%  This defines parser macros |\textLAT|, |\textLII|, \dots, |\textLIX|.
%  All support from |latxmp| is loaded also.
% \item |KOIxmp|: support for direct use of cyrillic letters by use
%  of upper-range characters (byte codes 148--255) under input
%  encodings KOI8-R and KOIR8-RU, using |\textKOI| as parser macro.
%  All support from |cyrxmp| is loaded also.
% \item |LGRxmp|: support for greek letters entered using either 
%  the LGR input transliteration of ASCII characters, or the ISO-8859-7
%  encoding of upper-range characters (byte codes 160--255),
%  or a combination of both, using |\textLGR| as parser macro.
%  All support from |grkxmp| is loaded also.
% \item |AR8xmp|: support for armenian letters entered using the
%  Arm\TeX~2.0 input transliteration of ASCII characters, or the
%  ArmSCII8 encoding of upper-range characters (byte codes 160--255),
%  or a combination of both, using |\textARM| as parser macro. 
%  All support from |armxmp| is loaded also.
% \item |HEBxmp|: support for hebrew letters entered using either 
%   LHE input transliteration of ASCII characters, or  the CP1255, CP862 
% or ISO-8859-8 (HE8) encoding of upper-range characters (byte codes 160--255),
%  or a combination of these using |\textLHE|, |\textHEBO|, |\textHEB| as parser macros.
%  All support from |hebxmp| is loaded also.
% \end{itemize}
% These `parser' options have received limited testing, so please 
% report any mistakes in the UTF-8 output that you may encounter.
%
% \subsection{Data file for metadata}\label{ssec-metadata}
%
% As mentioned above, standards-compliant PDF documents require 
% document-level metadata to be included. 
% This,  known as an `XMP packet'~\cite{XMP-spec,XMP-ISO}, 
% is like having a library catalog card included within the PDF itself. It is an unencrypted
% portion of the PDF file, with data expressed in Extensible Markup Language (XML),
% using Resource Description Format (RDF~\cite{RDF}) syntax, encoded as UTF-8 
% so readable by any text editing software on any modern computing platform.
%
% Some advantages of doing this are clear.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item For a librarian: cataloguing information is available within the file itself,
%   without the need to search explicitly in the visual layout of the content or elsewhere;
%  \item All actual libraries cataloguing this PDF can have consistent information;
%   including web-based indexing sites such as Google.
%  \item For the author(s): who can specify the kind of information most appropriate
%   to help readers understand the nature and purpose of the document.
% \end{itemize}
%   
% The |pdfx| package builds the XMP metadata from information supplied via a special data file 
% called |\jobname.xmpdata|. Here, |\jobname| is usually the basename of the document's main 
% |.tex| file. For example, if your document source is in the file |main.tex|, 
% then the metadata must be in a file called |main.xmpdata|. 
% None of the individual metadata fields are mandatory, but for most documents, it makes sense 
% to specify at least the title and the author. For more technical aspects of metadata
% and its uses, consult the work of the Dublin Core Initiative~\cite{DC} and PRISM~\cite{PRISM}.
%
% Here is a short |.xmpdata| file:
% \begin{decl}[]
%   |\Title{Baking through the ages}|\\
%   |\Author{A. Baker\sep C. Kneader}|\\
%   |\Language{en-GB}|\\
%   |\Keywords{cookies\sep muffins\sep cakes}|\\
%   |\Publisher{Baking International}|
% \end{decl}
% You should note that multiple authors and keywords have been separated
% by |\sep|. This |\sep| macro serves a technical purpose and is  
% permitted within the |\Author|, |\Keywords|, and |\Publisher| fields,
% as well as some others. See \S\ref{mdfields} below for a complete listing 
% of the supported author-supplied metadata fields.
%
% After processing, the local directory contains a file named such as
% |pdfa.xmpi| or |pdfe.xmpi| or |pdfx.xmpi| according to the PDF variant desired.
% This file is the complete XMP Metadata packet. 
% It can be checked for validity, using an online validator,  such as at 
% \href{http://www.pdflib.com/knowledge-base/xmp-metadata/free-xmp-validator/}{www.pdflib.com}.
% 
% \textbf{Warning}: The |\jobname.xmpdata| file may be included in the
% main document source, within a |{filecontents*}| environment, 
% provided this comes \emph{before} the |\documentclass| command, as follows.
% \begin{decl}[]
% |\begin{filecontents*}{\jobname.xmpdata}|\\
% |  \Title{Baking through the ages}|\\
% |  \Author{A. Baker\sep C. Kneader}|\\
% |  \Language{en-GB}|\\
% |  \Keywords{cookies\sep muffins\sep cakes}|\\
% |  \Publisher{Baking International}|\\
% |\end{filecontents*}|\\
% |\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}|\\
% |...|
% \end{decl}
% Including the metadata with the \LaTeX\ source is very convenient.
% Having it at the top of the file also brings attention to it, placing emphasis on 
% the desirability of including metadata, and keeping it accurate while the main 
% content of the document is subject to changes or revision. 
% Macro definitions can also occur prior to the |\documentclass| command, 
% including any that may be needed within the metadata. 
% An example of this is apparent in Figure~\ref{koi8-code} occurring later.
%
% However, this ordering is also extremely important, else any non-ascii UTF-8 byte 
% sequences can become active characters and expand upon data being written out, 
% rather than remaining as inactive bytes.
% If you edit the metadata supplied this way, remember to remove the
% existing copy of |\jobname.xmpdata| file before the next processing run,
% as \LaTeX\ does not write a new copy of the file when it exists on disk already, 
% within the current working directory or elsewhere that \LaTeX\ may find.
% In development or testing situations the filename may need to be given as
% |./\jobname.xmpdata|, else an older version may be loaded in error.
% 
% Experienced users/programmers can employ the \verb|\write18| mechanism%
% \footnote{If you don't already know what this is, they you probably 
% should not try using it |:-)|.}, together with the |--shell-escape| command-line 
% option, to automatically execute a shell command that removes |\jobname.xmpdata| 
% on every (or on selected) processing runs. 
% This is only useful when the metadata changes, for whatever reason.
%
% \medskip
% Other places for the |{filecontents*}| environment can work, 
% but \emph{only} when it contains \emph{no} non-ascii UTF-8 byte sequences.
% Since 2018, with default 
% See Section~\ref{ssec-symbols} below for more information on the macros
% that can be safely used within |.xmpdata| metadata files.
% 
% \subsection{List of supported metadata fields}\label{mdfields}
% 
% Following is a complete list of user-definable metadata fields currently supported,
% separated into particular groupings.
% Each command is accompanied by the specific XML tagged field name (with namespace) 
% that is placed into the document-level Metadata packet,  as well as the kind of information 
% being conveyed. 
% More may be added in the future.
% These commands can \emph{only} be used within the |.xmpdata| file.
%
% Most commands take an optional argument specifying the natural language,
% using RFC5646 (BCP 47)~\cite{BCP47} codes, in which the metadata field is given.
% Languages for multiple entries can use e.g., |\sep[de] ...|.
% Only those fields requiring a specific format (e.g. dates) do \emph{not}
% support language specifiers; these are indicated with \fixmd. 
% Fields allowing more than one value are indicated with \starmd.
% Multiple values may be given as separate instances of the macro, or as a single
% instance with the values delimited by |\sep|, as in the example above. 
% 
% \subsubsection{General information:}
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \starmd|\Author|: \hfill (|dc:creator|)\\
%  the document's human author(s). Separate multiple authors with |\sep|.
% \item \starmd|\Title|: \hfill (|dc:title|)\\
%  the document's title; multiple language versions are supported.
% \item \starmd\fixmd|\Language|: \hfill (|dc:language|)\\
%  list of languages used within the document.
% \item \starmd|\Keywords|: \hfill (|dc:subject|)\\
%   list of keywords, separated with |\sep|.
% \item \starmd|\Publisher|: \hfill (|dc:publisher|)\\
%  the publisher(s). Multiple pieces in a publishing chain should be separated with |\sep|.
% \item \starmd|\Subject|: \hfill (|dc:description|)\\
%  the abstract, or short description.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{Copyright information:}\label{sssec-copy}

%   and/or rights statement for this document.
% \item \fixmd|\Copyrighted|:  \hfill (|xmpRights:Marked|)\\
%  `True' if the document is copyrighted,  and `False' if it isn't. 
% This is automatically set to `True'  if either |\Copyright| or |\CopyrightURL| is specified, 
% but this can be overridden. 
%  For example, if the copyright statement is `Public Domain', 
%  then specify also |\Copyrighted{False}|.
%  \item \starmd|\Owner|:  \hfill (|xmpRights:Owner|)\\
%  specifies the owner(s) of the document or resource.
%  \item \fixmd|\CertificateURL|:  \hfill (|xmpRights:Certificate|)\\
%  gives the URL to online proof of ownership, if available.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{more Dublin Core metadata:}\label{sssec-dc}
% From version 1.6 of |pdfx.sty|, the following fields can be used to provide a greater 
% range of information to be specified as metadata. 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \starmd|\Contributor|: \hfill (|dc:contributor|)\\
%  contributor(s) other than author(s) of the PDF document.
% \item |\Coverage|: \hfill (|dc:coverage|)\\
%  statement about the extent or scope of the document's contents.
% \item \starmd\fixmd|\Date|: \hfill (|dc:date|)\\
%  date(s) when something significant occurred relating to the resource (e.g., version changes); 
%  must be in ISO date format |YYYY-MM-DD| or |YYYY-MM|.
% \item \fixmd|\PublicationType|: \hfill (|dc:type|)\\
%  The type of publication. If specified, must be one of `book', `catalog', `feed', `journal', 
% `magazine', `manual', `newsletter', `pamphlet'. This is automatically set to `journal'
%   if |\Journaltitle| is specified (see below), but can be overridden.
% \item \starmd|\Relation|: \hfill (|dc:relation|)\\
%  how this PDF or resource relates to other document(s) or resources.
% \item \fixmd|\Source|: \hfill (|dc:source|)\\
%  specifies a source document from which the PDF is derived.
% \item \fixmd|\Doi|: \hfill (|dc:identifier|, |prism:doi|, |prism:url|)\\
%   Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the document, without the leading `doi:'.
% \item \fixmd|\ISBN|: \hfill (|dc:identifier|)\\
%  the ISBN for the PDF itself, or Book/Monograph of which it is part.
% \item \fixmd|\URLlink|: \hfill (|dc:identifier|, |prism:url|)\\
%  gives a URL address for an online copy of the document.
% \end{itemize}
%
%  The remaining Dublin Core field |(dc:format)| is always set to `|application/pdf|'.
% 
% \subsubsection{Publication information:}\label{sssec-publ}
% The following macros allow for inclusion of publication related metadata fields, 
% as specified by PRISM~\cite{PRISM} to meet publishing requirements. 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |\Journaltitle|: \hfill (|prism:issueName|)\\
% The title of the journal in which the document was published.
% \item \fixmd|\Journalnumber|: \hfill (|prism:issn|)\\
%  The ISSN for the journal/series in which the document was published.
% \item \fixmd|\Volume|: \hfill (|prism:volume|)\\
%  Journal volume.
% \item \fixmd|\Issue|:  \hfill (|prism:number|)\\
%  Journal issue/number.
% \item \fixmd|\Firstpage|:  \hfill (|prism:startingPage|, |prism:pageRange|)\\
%  First page number of the published version of the document.
% \item \fixmd|\Lastpage|:  \hfill (|prism:endingPage|, |prism:pageRange|)\\
%  Last page number of the published version of the document.
% \item |\CoverDisplayDate|:  \hfill (|prism:coverDisplayDate|)\\
% Date on the cover of the journal issue, as a human-readable text string.
% \item \fixmd|\CoverDate|:   \hfill (|prism:coverDate|)\\
%  Date on the cover of the journal issue, in a format suitable for storing in a database 
%  field with a `date' data type; e.g. |YYYY-MM|, or |YYYY-MM-DD|.
% \end{itemize}
% This is an area which can be expanded, to deal with more kinds
% of publication and metadata fields.
% The ExtensionSchema \cite{TN0009} technique is used to add new fields.
% Examples of this can be found in the template files |pdfx.xmp|, |pdfa.xmp|, |pdfe.xmp|.
%
% \subsubsection{Backward Compatibility}
% The following macros are also recognised, for backward compatibility 
% with earlier versions of the package.
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item \starmd|\AuthoritativeDomain|: \hfill (|pdfx:AuthoritativeDomain|)\\
%  specifies extra names (e.g., of companies) associated to the existence of the PDF or resource.
%  \item |\Creator|: \hfill (|xmp:CreatorTool|)\\
%  synonymous with |\CreatorTool| which is usually handled automatically anyway, 
%  but can be over-ridden.
%  \item |\Org|: synonymous with |\Publisher|.
%  \item |\WebStatement|: synonymous with |\CopyrightURL|.
%  \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection{more XMP metadata:}\label{sssec-xmp}
% 
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item \starmd|\Advisory|: \hfill (|xmp:Advisory|)\\
%   noteworthy information; e.g., revision data or changes.
%  \item \fixmd|\BaseURL|: \hfill (|xmp:BaseURL|)\\
%   base-URL for relative hyperlinks within the PDF.

%  \item |\Nickname|: \hfill (|xmp:Nickname|)\\
%  a pseudonym or `nickname' as a colloquial identifier for the resource.
%  \item \starmd|\Thumbnails|: \hfill (|xmp:Thumbnails|)\\
%  allows small page images to be associated with each page of the PDF.
%  An appropriate XML-compatible representation is required for such images.
%  \end{itemize}
%
% \subsubsection{PDF standards metadata:}\label{sssec-pdfstd}
% The following metadata fields are generated automatically by the \LaTeX\ engine.
%  Some are dependent on the particular loading options that specify the desired compliance
%  with a PDF standard, and level of conformance.
%  There are no separate user-macros to alter these.
%  The first three dates are usually set to be identical.
% 
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item (|xmp:CreateDate|) : creation date\&time of the PDF.
%  \item (|xmp:MetadataDate|) : creation date\&time of the Metadata for the PDF.
%  \item (|xmp:ModifyDate|) : date\&time of latest modifications to the PDF.
%  \item (|xmpMM:DocumentID|) : unique identifier for the PDF, based on MD5 sum.
%  \item (|xmpMM:InstanceID|) : unique identifier based on creation date\&time.
%  \item (|pdf:Producer|) :  \TeX\ engine used; either `Lua\TeX', `Xe\TeX', `\pdftex'.
%  \item (|pdf:Trapped|) : currently always set to `False'.
%  \item (|pdfaid:part|) :  |1|, |2| or |3| for PDF/A-?
%  \item (|pdfaid:conformance|) : |a|, |b| or |u| for PDF/A-??
%  \item (|pdfuaid:part|) :  currently |1| for PDF/UA-1
%  \item (|pdfe:ISO_PDFEVersion|) :  currently |1| for PDF/E-1
%  \item (|pdf:Version|) : |PDF/X-1|, |PDF/X-2| or |PDF/X-3| 
%  \item (|pdfx:GTS_PDFXVersion|) : e.g., |PDF/X-1a:2003| up to PDF/X-3 ;
%   but no year for PDF/X-4 and PDF/X-5 variants
%  \item (|pdfx:GTS_PDFXConformance|) :  e.g., |PDF/X-1a:2003| up to PDF/X-2
%  \item (|pdfxid:GTS_PDFXVersion|) : e.g., |PDF/X-4p:2008| after PDF/X-3
%  \item (|pdfvtid:GTS_PDFVTVersion|) : e.g., |PDF/VT-2s| for PDF/VT
%  \item (|pdfvtid:GTS_PDFVTModDate|) : same as |xmp:ModifyDate|
%  \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Symbols permitted in metadata}\label{ssec-symbols}
%
% Within the metadata, all printable ASCII characters except
% |\|, |{|, |}| and |%| represent themselves. Also, all printable Unicode characters 
% from the basic multilingual plane (i.e., up to code point U+FFFF) 
% can be used directly with the UTF-8 encoding.
% (Please note: encodings other than UTF-8 are not supported in the metadata, 
% except as arguments to `parser-macros'; see Section~\ref{ssec-xmplang}). 
% Consecutive whitespace characters are combined into a single space. 
% Whitespace after a macro such as |\copyright|, |\backslash|, or |\sep| is ignored. 
% Blank lines are not permitted.
% Moreover, the following markup can be used:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item ``|\ |'':           a literal space  (for example after a macro)
% \item |\%|:           a literal |%|
% \item |\{|:           a literal |{|
% \item |\}|:           a literal |}|
% \item |\backslash|:   a literal backslash |\|
% \item |\copyright|:   the copyright symbol \textcopyright
% \end{itemize}
% The macro |\sep| is permitted within |\Author|, |\Keywords|,
% |\Publisher|, and other macros marked with \starmd\ above. 
% It's purpose is to separate multiple authors, keywords, etc. 
% to appear as separate list items appropriately and consistently 
% in the different ways that such information is represented 
% within the PDF file. 
% The package takes care of this when |\sep| is used.
% For example, in the XMP metadata, it expands as |</rdf:li><rdf:li>| tagging.
%
% \subsubsection{PDF Info strings}\label{sssec-info}
%  When |\sep| is not used within its argument, the metadata from  |\Title|,  
% |\Author| and |\Keywords| is also included in the PDF |/Info| dictionary. 
% When this is the case, validation for the declared standard
% will occur only if the corresponding |/Info| item and XMP metadata field
% convert to exactly the same Unicode string. 
% This cannot happen when |\sep| is used, so the |/Info| items are then not populated.
%
%  Unfortunately not all PDF browsers (in particular, older ones and much Apple software)
%  give ready access to the XMP metadata packet. Some authors want to see everything
%  using e.g., the Unix/Linux command: |pdfinfo -enc UTF-8 |. In fact there is the |-meta| 
%  option to get the complete metadata packet (in UTF-8 encoding). 
%  This can give more than what one wants, so use it as follows:
% \begin{decl}[]
%    pdfinfo -meta  <filename>.pdf  \textbar\ grep 'dc:'
% \end{decl}
%  to extract just the Dublin Core metadata fields.
%  
%  Another possibility is to \emph{not} use |\sep| with multiple authors and/or keywords.
%  Instead replace it with simply `|, |'. We do not recommend doing this, as more sophisticated
%  metadata tools will see the result as a single value, rather than multiple authors, say.
%  Different language codes cannot be applied when done this way.
%  However, some authors may find this a satisfactory solution that suits their own tools.
%
%
% \subsection{Macros permitted in metadata}\label{ssec-macros}
%
% Other \TeX\ macros actually can be used, provided the author is very 
% careful and not ask for too-complicated \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ expansions
% into internal commands or non-character primitives; basically just accents,
% macros for Latin-based special characters, and simple textual replacements,
% perhaps with a simple parameter. A special macro |\pdfxEnableCommands{...}| 
% is provided to help resolve difficulties that may arise.
%
% Here is an example\footnote{ Other use cases are discussed with regard to
% Figures~\ref{arm-code} and \ref{math-wflow}.} of the use of |\pdfxEnableCommands|, 
% which occurs with the name of one of our authors {(H\`an Th\'{\^e} Thanh)} 
% due to the doubly-accented letter \'{\^e}.
% It is usual to define a macro such as: |\def\thanh{H\`an Th\'{\^e} Thanh}|.
% In previous versions of the |pdfx| package, use of such a macro 
% within the |.xmpdata| file, in the |Copyright| information say,
% could result in the accent macros expanding into internal primitives, such as 
% \begin{decl}[]
% | H\unhbox \voidb@x \bgroup \let \unhbox \voidb@x \setbox \@tempboxa ... |
% \end{decl}
% going on for many lines. This clearly has no place within the XMP metadata.
% To get around this, one could try using simplified macro definitions
% \begin{decl}[]
% |  \pdfxEnableCommands{|\\
% |      \def\`#1{#1^^cc^80}\def\'#1{#1^^cc^81}\def\^#1{#1^^cc^82}}|
% \end{decl}
% \removelastskip\noindent
% where the |^^cc^80|, |^^cc^81|, |^^cc^82| cause \TeX\ to generate the correct 
% UTF-8 bytes for `combining accent' characters.
%
% This works fine for metadata fields that appear just in the XMP packet.
% However, it is not sufficient for the PDF |/Author| key, which must exactly match
% with the |dc:creator| metadata element. What is needed instead is
% \begin{decl}[]
% |  \pdfxEnableCommands{|\\
% |       \def\thanh{H^^c3^^a0n Th\eee Thanh}\def\eee{^^c3^^aa^^cc^^81 }}|
% \end{decl}
% \removelastskip\noindent
% or the above with `\`a' typed directly as UTF-8 instead of |^^c3^^a0| 
% and `\^e' in UTF-8 for |^^c3^^aa|.
% The reason for this is due to the |\pdfstringdef| command, which constructs
% the accented latin letters as single combined characters \`a and \^e, 
% without resorting to combining accents, wherever possible.
% If the Metadata does not have the same, irrespective of Unicode normalisation, 
% then validation fails.
%
% With version (1.5.6) of the |pdfx| package, such difficulties
% have been overcome, at least for characters used in Western European, 
% Latin-based languages. The input encoding used when reading the |.xmpdata| 
% file now includes interpretations of \TeX's usual accent commands to 
% produce the required UTF-8 byte sequences.
%
% \medskip
% Since version (1.5.8) this input encoding was extended to include 
% macro definitions covering \LaTeX's internal character representation
% of other alphabets (e.g., extended Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, etc.).
% However this can become memory intensive, requiring a large number of
% macro definitions, most of which will never be used. So loading options
% are provided, enabling a document author to choose only those that may
% be relevant. Currently these are as in Section~\ref{ssec-xmplang}.
%
% A significant portion of the Unicode Basic Plane characters can be covered
% this way. Modules could even be provided for CJK character sets and 
% mathematical symbols, etc. However, as this can become memory intensive,
% significant testing will be required before these become a standard
% part of the |pdfx| package. 
%
% 
% \subsection{Color profiles}\label{sec-profiles}
%
% Most standards compliant PDF documents require a \emph{color
% profile} to be embedded within the file. In a nutshell, such a profile
% determines precisely how the colors used in the document will be
% rendered when printed to a physical medium. This can be used to
% ensure that the document will look exactly the same, even when it is
% printed on different printers, with different paper types, etc. 
% The inclusion of a color profile is necessary to make the document 
% completely self-contained.
%
% Since most \LaTeX\ users are not graphics professionals and are not
% particularly picky about colors, the |pdfx| package includes default
% profiles that will be included when nothing else is specified. 
% Therefore, the average user doesn't have to do anything
% special about color.
%
% For users who have a specific color profile they wish to use, it is
% possible to do so by including a |\setRGBcolorprofile| or
% |\setCMYKcolorprofile| command in the |.xmpdata| file. Note that
% PDF/A and PDF/E require a profile of type `|mnrt|' (monitor) which 
% is usually an RGB color profile, while PDF/X and PDF/VT require type `|prtr|' 
% (printer) which is usually a CMYK color profile; but valid documents
% can be created with the correct type designed for the other color space.
% Use the following commands to specify an RGB or CMYK color profile, 
% respectively:
% 
% \begin{decl}
% \defmacro{setRGBcolorprofile}\marg{filename}\marg{identifier}\marg{info
% string}\marg{registry URL}
% \\[1ex]
% \defmacro{setCMYKcolorprofile}\marg{filename}\marg{output
% intent}\marg{identifier}\marg{registry URL}
% \end{decl}
% Within the arguments of these macros, the characters |<|, |>|, |&|,
% |^|, |_|, |#|, |$|, and |~| can be used as themselves, but
% |%| must be escaped as |\%|. 
%
%  From version (1.6) the default RGB and CMYK color profiles are now supplied
%  using the |colorprofiles| package by Norbert Preining and Ross Moore~\cite{colorp}.
%  Earlier versions of \texttt{pdfx.sty} set the defaults via:
% \begin{decl}[]
% |\setRGBcolorprofile{sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc}|\\
% |                   {sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled}|\\
% |                   {sRGB IEC61966 v2.1 with black scaling}|\\
% |                   {http://www.color.org}|\\[4pt]
% |\setCMYKcolorprofile{coated_FOGRA39L_argl.icc}|\\
% |                    {Coated FOGRA39}|\\
% |                    {FOGRA39 (ISO Coated v2 300\% (ECI))}|\\
% |                    {http://www.argyllcms.com/}|
% \end{decl}
%  These can still be used if the files from earlier version are available
%  on your \TeX\ system, but they will need to be requested, as above.
% Other color profile files may be obtained from the International
% Color Consortium.  Please take a look at
% \url{http://www.color.org/iccprofile.xalter}.
%
% Alternatively, color profiles are shipped with many Adobe software
% applications; these are then available for use also with non-Adobe 
% software. Now the |pdfx| package includes coding to streamline
% inclusion of these profiles in PDF documents, or to specify
% them as `external' profiles, with PDF/X-4p and PDF/X-5pg variants.
% Two files |AdobeColorProfiles.tex| and |AdobeExternalProfiles.tex|
% are distributed with the |pdfx| package. The latter is for use
% with PDF/X-4p and PDF/X-5pg, which do not require color profiles to
% be embedded, while the former can be used with other PDF/X variants.
% Both define commands to use Color Profiles as follows.
% \begin{decl}[]
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  \texttt{\string\FOGRAXXXIX} & Coated FOGRA39 (ISO 12647-2:2004)\\

% \end{decl}
% As of the time of first compiling this list, only the first six of these result in PDFs
% which can validate with external profiles (i.e., for PDF/X-4p and PDF/X-5pg)
% using the then-current versions of Adobe Acrobat Pro software. It is unclear
% whether the others (incl.\,\verb|\IFRAXXVI| and \verb|\IFRAXXX|) failed due 
% to incorrect data or problems in the validation software. 
% Since then, with updates to Acrobat Pro, almost all the others have been verified
% to work, except \verb|\IFRAXXX| which seems no longer available.
% Thus these commands come with a `use at own risk' clause. 
%
% For `external' profiles, there is a command |\setEXTERNALprofile|, taking 9 arguments, 
% that must be used. Consult |AdobeExternalProfiles.tex| for examples of its use.
% 
% All but the last of the macros listed above can also be used for valid embedded profiles, 
% providing the corresponding files can be found. 
% The following macros are used to set the (absolute or relative) path, 
% on the local operating system, to the location of color profile files.
% \begin{decl}
%  \defmacro{pdfxSetRGBcolorProfileDir}\marg{path to RGB color profiles}\\
%  \defmacro{pdfxSetCMYKcolorProfileDir}\marg{path to CMYK profiles}
% \end{decl}
% On a Macintosh, there are various places where the color profiles may be found.
%  One can use either a macro |\MacOSColordir| which expands
%  into the path for system-provided profiles:
% \begin{decl}[]
% |/System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/|  
% \end{decl}
% or the macro |\MacOSLibraryColordir| expanding to:
% \begin{decl}[]
%  |/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/|
% \end{decl}
% or |\AdobeMacOSdir| which expands into the path:
% \begin{decl}[]
% |/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Color/Profiles/Recommended/|
% \end{decl}
% Under Windows an available macro is |\WindowsColordir| which expands to: 
% \begin{decl}[]
% |C:\Windows\System32\Spool\Drivers\Color/|
% \end{decl}
% being the common location for color profiles.
% Use these within the \verb|.xmpdata| file as, e.g., 
% \begin{decl}[]
%  |\pdfxSetCMYKcolorProfileDir{\AdobeMacOSdir}|
% \end{decl}
% Authors may change the paths to suit their own circumstances, either
% \emph{before} loading |pdfx.sty| or within the \verb|.xmpdata| file. 
%
% PDF/A and PDF/E usually need an RGB profile, while PDF/X and PDF/VT
% require a CMYK profile. It is possible to use a CMYK profile with PDF/A 
% or PDF/E by specifying |\setRGBcolorprofile{}{}{}{}| in the \verb|.xmpdata| file.
% Beware however, that with PDF/A any coloured hyperlink annotations can
% cause a validation problem, as these are interpreted as RGB colours 
% even when 4 components are given. This may be a bug in validators,
% as PDF specifies that the number of components should match the color space.
%
% \subsubsection{`Custom' color spaces}\label{ssec-custom}
%
%  It is also possible to specify `Custom' color spaces, other than RGB or CMYK.
%  Here is an example command |\viiIndigoTAC|, defined as follows:
% \begin{decl}[]
% \%\% Custom profile:  7C Indigo TAC370 (ColorLogic)\\
% |\gdef\viiIndigoTAC{\let\CallasMacOSdir\CallasMacOSpdfaPilotdir |\\
% | \setCUSTOMcolorprofile |\\
% |  {7C Indigo_TAC370_ColorLogic.icc}%|\\
% |  {\CallasProfilesdir}%|\\
% |  {7C Indigo TAC370 \string\(ColorLogic\string\)}%  /ProfileName |\\
% |  {http://www.colorlogic.de}% /RegistryName |\\
% |  {7CLR}% number of colors specifier |\\
% |  {02400000}%  ICC version |\\
% |  {/Cyan /Magenta /Yellow /Black /Orange /Green /Violet}%  colour names |\\
% |  {48110b8b410ee6be015f3932c3167869}%  CheckSum |\\
% |}|
% \end{decl}
%  which uses a profile that accompanies the \texttt{pdfaPilot} software from
%  Callas Software Gmbh~\cite{pdfaPilot}.
%  The macro |\CallasMacOSpdfaPilotdir|, defined in the file \texttt{CallasColorProfiles.tex}, 
%  specifies the directory where this Custom profile is located, when installed under MacOS.
%  One needs to |\input CallasColorProfiles.tex| \emph{before} loading the |pdfx| package.
%  Macros for other directories are also defined in this file. 
%
% \subsection{Notes on the internal representation of metadata}
%                    
% Within the PDF file, metadata is deposited in two places: some data
% goes into the native PDF |/Info| dictionary, and some data goes into
% an XMP packet stored separately within the file. XMP is Adobe's
% Extensible Metadata Platform~\cite{XMP-spec,XMP-ISO}, and is an XML-based format. 
% See \href{http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp/}{Adobe XMP Development Center}
% for more exhaustive information about XMP.  
% An XMP Toolkit SDK which supports the GNU/Linux, Macintosh and Windows operating
% systems is also available under modified BSD licence.
%
% Some of the metadata, such as the author, title, and keywords, can be
% stored \emph{both} in the XMP packet and in the |/Info| dictionary. 
% For the resulting file to be standards-compliant, the two copies of the data 
% must be identical. This is taken care of automatically by the |pdfx| package,
% except when |\sep| is used to handle multiple entries, as discussed above
% in \S\ref{sssec-info}. In such cases the string is not included within the |/Info| 
% dictionary. Note that this is in accordance with the PDF 2.0 specification~\cite{PDF20},
% which deprecates use of the |/Info| dictionary for such metadata.
% 
% In principle, users can resort to alternate ways to create an XMP file 
% for inclusion in PDF. In this case, one should create a customised template 
% file |pdfa.xmp| or |pdfx.xmp| or |pdfe.xmp| (etc., depending on the PDF flavor)
% containing the pre-defined data. This can be done by modifying the ones supplied 
% with the |pdfx| package. However, this is an error-prone process and is 
% \emph{not} recommended for most users. 
% If there is a particular field of metadata that you need and that is not currently
% supported, please contact the package authors.
%
% |pdfx| makes use of the |xmpincl| package to include XMP data into
% the PDF.  The documentation of |xmpincl| package may help interested
% users to understand the process of XMP data inclusion.
% 
% \subsection{Tutorials and technical notes}
%
% A tutorial with step-by-step instructions for generating PDF/A files
% can be found at:
% \url{http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/}.
%
% Some technical notes about production problems the authors have
% encountered while generating PDF/A compliant documents are available
% here:
% \url{http://support.river-valley.com/wiki/index.php?title=Generating_PDF/A_compliant_PDFs_from_pdftex}.
%  Be aware that this is based on use of an earlier version of the |pdfx| package,
%  so some of the advice may have been superseded.
% 
%
% \section[Installing]{Installing}
% The |pdfx.dtx| package is available on CTAN as usual, via
%  \url{http://ctan.org/pkg/pdfx}. It is also included in
% \TeX\ distributions such as Mac\TeX, \TeX\ Live and MiK\TeX.
% Thus most users will not need to handle installation at all.
%
% For those wishing to do a manual installation, here are some notes.
% The file |pdfx.dtx| is a composite document of program code and
% documentation in \LaTeX{} format, in the tradition of \emph{literate
% programming}. After having installed the package, 
% to get the documentation that you are reading now,
% run (\textsc{pdf})\LaTeX{} on the file |pdfx.dtx|. 
% The resulting PDF should be valid as PDF/A-2u.
% Or better, use the included |Makefile|, which will also regenerate the index.
%
% To install the package, first extract the program code; i.e., the
% file |pdfx.sty|, by running \LaTeX{} or \TeX{} on the file |pdfx.ins|. 
% Create a directory named |pdfx| under |$TEXMF/tex/latex| and copy the files
%  |pdfx.sty|, |8bit.def|, |glyphtounicode-cmr.tex|, |glyphtounicode-ntx.tex| as well 
% as the other |*.tex|, |l8u*-penc.def| and |*.xmp| files, into it. Then update
% \TeX's file database using the appropriate command for your distribution
% and operating system (such as |texhash| or |mktexlsr|, or similar).
% 
% \subsection{Limitations and dependencies}
% 
% The |pdfx.sty| package works with \pdftex\ and also Lua\TeX\ and Xe\TeX\ 
% with some minor limitations.  
% It further depends on the following other packages.
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item |xmpincl|  for insertion of metadata into PDF.
%  \item |inputenc|  to establish input-encoding infrastructure ---
%    see Section~\ref{ssec-L8U}.
%  \item |hyperref| for ensuring data is correctly encoded when being
%   written into the PDF file, and supporting features such as
%   hyperlinking, bookmarks, etc.
%  \item |xcolor| for ensuring consistent use of the color model
%    appropriate the PDF variant, within text and hyperlinks (when allowed).
%  \item |glyphtounicode.tex| (not Xe\LaTeX) maps glyph names 
%   to corresponding Unicode code-points.
%  \item |ifluatex|  allowing coding specific to Lua\LaTeX.
%  \item |ifxetex|  allowing coding specific to Xe\LaTeX.
%  \item |luatex85| or |pdftexcmds| (Lua\TeX\ only) for access 
%   to primitive commands using \pdftex\ macro names.
%  \item |stringenc| used to help generate proper bookmarks with transliterated input; 
%    e.g., with |\textLGR| or |\textARM| --- see Section~\ref{sssec-arm}.
% \end{enumerate}
% Other files and packages are loaded as sub-packages or as
% configuration files for these. Since some of these packages 
% may be loaded by existing documents we provide here advice on 
% how to deal with potential loading and option conflicts.
%
% Firstly, it is best if |pdfx| is the first package loaded; e.g.,
% directly after the |\documentclass| line. This is not a strict requirement, 
% but it is worthwhile to deal with the metadata at the top of your \LaTeX\ source,
% allowing correct options to be loaded to cope with validation aspects.
%
% Secondly, replace |\usepackage[<options>]{hyperref}| with |\hypersetup{<options>}|.
% This deals with most loading issues with the |hyperref| package. 
% Note that PDF/X is a format intended for printing. 
% It forbids inclusion of hyperlinks and other actions, including via bookmarks.
% To produce a validating PDF/X document, |pdfx| overrides internal macros
% while keeping colors associated with link anchors.
% To inhibit these colors also, you could specify options as follows.
% \begin{decl}[]
%  |\hypersetup{colorlinks,allcolors=black}|
% \end{decl}
% Furthermore, options to set metadata components (such as |pdfauthor|,
% |pdftitle|, |pdfsubject|, |pdfkeywords|, etc.) are disabled, since
% |pdfx| has already taken care of this information.
% 
% Thirdly, conflicts with other packages may be dealt with by simply
% changing |\usepackage| to |\RequirePackage| within the document's
% preamble. But this may not be possible when the |\usepackage| 
% or |\RequirePackage| command occurs within another package, or with
% a specific set of options, thereby causing processing to stop. 
% Few packages have a command analogous to |\hypersetup|. 
% Instead |\PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}| can help.
% For |<options>| specify the ones associated with the loading yet to come.
% This can give a smooth processing run, but you'll need to check whether
% the results from those options have actually taken effect.
% Some examples of this can be seen later, in Figures~\ref{koi8-code} 
% and \ref{tldoc-pol}.
%
% \subsubsection{Limitations using Xe\LaTeX}\label{sssec-xetex}
%
% To process a file using Xe\LaTeX, to produce a document that can 
% validate to a particular PDF standard, one need to use a command
% to run the \TeX\ engine, as follows.
% \begin{decl}[]
%   |xelatex -shell-escape -output-driver="xdvipdfmx -z 0" <filename>.tex |
% \end{decl}
% The |-shell-escape| option allows a command-line task to be run,
% which writes the creation-date \& time of the running job into 
% a small file on disk. This data, written in a specific format, is then 
% read by the job for inclusion into several metadata fields.
% This emulates the result of \pdftex's |\pdfcreationdate| primitive.
% As there are security implications in allowing arbitrary commands to be run,
% this need for |-shell-escape| must be viewed as imposing a limitation on the 
% work-flows in which this can be safely used.
%
% The |-output-driver="xdvipdfmx -z 0"| suppresses compression, which 
%  is not allowed for the XMP metadata packet. Without this, the resulting PDF
%  may fail to pass validation tests. 
%
% Xe\TeX\ is designed for processing UTF-8 input only. When presented
% with \LaTeX\ source using a legacy encoding, such as |latin2| or |koi8-r|, 
% the input is accepted and a PDF produced. Yet there will be garbage 
% characters corresponding to each character entered from the upper range
% (128--255). This is evident in the PDF content and bookmarks; 
% yet |pdfx| produces the correct XMP metadata packet.
% So while the techniques explained later in Section~\ref{ssec-multi} are
% valid, the PDF itself does not contain correct content.
%
% Not all fonts, in particular Open-Type fonts (OTF), naturally come with
% mappings of the glyphs to Unicode code points. This is a requirement
% with PDF/A, PDF/E and PDF/UA standards. 
% Use of such fonts can result in validation errors, such as:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%  CIDset in subset font is incomplete (font contains glyphs that are not listed).
% \item
%  Type 2 CID font: CIDToGID map is invalid or missing.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% If one has access to Adobe's |Acrobat Pro| software, then its |Preflight|
% utility can rewrite the uncompressed output from Xe\LaTeX\ into a valid
% PDF standard, using compression of the contents but not of the XMP packet.
% Similarly |Preflight| can sometimes fix the missing font information.
%
%
% \subsubsection{Limitations using Lua\LaTeX}\label{sssec-luatex}
%
% Lua\LaTeX\ can handle the OTF font issues mentioned for Xe\LaTeX,
% so can produce valid PDF/A documents where Xe\LaTeX\ fails.
% However, since Lua\TeX\ expects all input source to be UTF8-encoded,  
% it cannot work at all with documents using older legacy encodings.
% Instead one gets error messages such as:
%\begin{decl}
% |! String contains an invalid utf-8 sequence.|\\
% |l.5 \Copyright{\textLII{UWAGA dla recenzent|\\
% |                                         �w/t³umaczy}}|\\
% |? |
%\end{decl}
% from a document using |latin2| encoded characters.
% Thus most of Section~\ref{ssec-multi} is just not applicable for Lua\LaTeX,
% whereas it is for \pdftex.
% This is essentially the same problem as described above for Xe\TeX,
% but here Lua\TeX\ advises that there are problems as soon as it
% encounters an invalid (for UTF-8) character. Some would regard
% this as better than having the job run to completion, only to later
% discover garbage content within the PDF.
%
%

% \section[Multilingual and Technical Considerations]{Multilingual and Technical Considerations}\label{sec-meta}
% 
% \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ have an on-going practice of including metadata within 
% the source files and package documentation. Usually this is done as comments 
% at the beginning of the file; such as the following from the English
% language version of the 2015 \TeX\ Live documentation\footnote{%
% found at |/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf-dist/doc/texlive/texlive-en/|.}.
% \begin{decl}[]
% |$Id: texlive-en.tex 37205 2015-05-05 21:36:33Z karl $|\\
% |TeX Live documentation.  Originally written by Sebastian Rahtz and|\\
% |Michel Goossens, now maintained by Karl Berry and others.|\\
% |Public domain.|
% \end{decl}
% This provides information, ideally suited for copyright metadata 
% fields, as in Section~\ref{sssec-copy}, as well as for |\Subject| 
% and |\CoverDate| from Section~\ref{sssec-publ}. 
% 
% Also near the top of the file one finds front-matter content
% \begin{decl}[]
% |\title{%|\\
% | {\huge \textit{The \TeX\ Live Guide---2015}}|\\
% |}|\\
% |\author{Karl Berry, editor \\[3mm]|\\
% |       \url{http://tug.org/texlive/}|\\
% |      }|\\
% |\date{May 2015}|
% \end{decl}
% which supplies metadata information for the commands |\Title|, |\Author|, 
% |\CoverDisplayDate| also from Section~\ref{sssec-publ}, and |\CopyrightURL|.
%
% Most of the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of documents prepared
% using \TeX, \LaTeX\ and other \TeX-based formats, include similar
% metadata information, much of which currently does not accompany the
% resulting PDF. It is becoming increasingly common, if not yet a legal
% requirement, for PDFs to satisfy a standard that requires inclusion
% of metadata. This is especially so for government agencies and institutions
% receiving government funding, in several countries around the world.
% 
% It is an aim of the |pdfx| to simplify the process of capturing and
% including metadata within \LaTeX-produced PDFs, from both the author's 
% view and that of archivists. The extra features introduced with version 
% 1.5.8 take a large step in that direction. 
% This includes the ability, described in the next subsection, to reliably
% include data presented in different text encodings, rather than being
% restricted to UTF-8 only. It is a role of the software to make the 
% conversion, rather than rely on some 3rd party for a translation.
%
%
% \subsection[Multilingual Metadata]{Multilingual Metadata}\label{ssec-multi}
%
% A cursory search of the documentation (|.../texmf-dist/doc|) subtree
% of the forthcoming \TeX\,Live 2016 release reveals more than 730 different
% |.tex| or |.dtx| document sources which specify an input encoding,
% via the |\usepackage[...]{inputenc}| command. Roughly 380 (a bit more 
% than half) declare UTF-8 as the input encoding. 
% Of the remainder there are $\approx 20$ other encodings specified, 
% covering a range of languages for at least part of their content. 
% At some point in time, these documents may be required to have accurate
% accompanying metadata, as part of conformance to a designated PDF 
% (or other) standard. There are libraries and archives that already must 
% meet such standards.
%
% We have shown above, in Section~\ref{ssec-metadata}, how the |.xmpdata| 
% file can be inserted into the document source, which then ensures that 
% metadata is reliably transferred along with the source itself.
% This seems a good strategy, but are there any problems with it,
% especially in a multi-lingual context?
% 
% Modern editing software can require an encoding to be associated 
% with each file. This is what allows the correct characters to be shown, 
% from what is otherwise just a sequence of 8-bit bytes. The flip-side 
% is that arbitrary editing is not permitted. Add some UTF-8 data into 
% a file that is encoded as Latin-2 then try to save it. You may be asked 
% to specify a new encoding, or the application may even crash out entirely.
% Maybe this happens \emph{accidentally}. It is not hard for a curly quote 
% (`) or endash (--) to be included; many editors have settings which can 
% do this with normal ascii input. Turn \emph{off} such settings.
%
% The approach that we advocate is that when editing to add metadata,
% best is to: 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item 
%  use the \emph{same encoding} as is specified for the file itself, 
%  if known (as is usually the case);
% \item 
%  even if 1. is not possible, use Copy/Paste \emph{within} the document source 
%  (e.g., for authors' names, addresses, affiliations, etc.) and from comments, 
%  as in Section~\ref{sec-meta} above;
% \item
%  avoid typing new characters, especially quotes and dashes, and be extra
%  careful with back-spacing to preserve the real meaning of copied content.
% \end{enumerate}
% Even if the original encoding is not known, use of Copy/Paste from other
% parts of the document is normally not going to change its encoding.
% This should not cause the file to become invalid due to mixed content.
% In some situations it may be necessary to use an ASCII-only representation,
% such as \LaTeX's LICR\footnote{LICR: \LaTeX\ Internal Character Representation;
% or think `I $=$ Interchange'.} macros~\cite[\S\,7.11]{LC2}.

% \subsubsection[Metadata with Cyrillics]{Metadata with Cyrillics}\label{sssec-cyr}
%
% Here is a `real-world' example, with Figure\,\ref{koi8-meta} showing the metadata
% as could be produced for the Russian language version of the \TeX\ Live documentation,
% from coding as shown in Figure\,\ref{koi8-code}.
% The source file itself is actually encoded for KOI8-R, as indicated by the presence
% of the code line |\usepackage[koi8-r]{inputenc}|, 
% but is deliberately shown here encoded as |T1|~\cite[p.\,449]{LC2}.
% This difference is immaterial for checking the validity of the metadata.
% For example, the stream of upper (accents, etc.) characters within
% |\Title{\textKOI{ ... }}| is the same as within |\title{...\textit{ ... }}|.
% Similarly for |\Author{\textKOI{...}}| and |\author{...}|, and |\CoverDate| and |\date|.
% Strings for the |\Subject| and |\Keywords| are taken from the first actual paragraph
% in the document, and from early subsection titles.
%
% It is the `parser' command/macro |\textKOI{ ... }| that indicates that the upper range
% characters (having byte codes 128--255) are to be treated as KOI8-R characters, 
% rather than as part of UTF-8 byte sequences. It works by examining each byte in sequence,
% and returning the appropriate UTF-8 2-byte sequence for the required cyrillic character. 
% This happens during the processing of data from |\jobname.xmpdata| for fleshing-out 
% the XMP metadata packet to be included within the final PDF/A document.
%
% The `parser' macros defined for various encodings, are given in Figure\,\ref{parsers}.
% In Section\,\ref{ssec-xmplang} the package options are given 
% for loading the appropriate support for desired languages or alphabets.
% Support for other encodings can be added, if there proves to be a need.

%
% With encoded characters marked in this way with a `parser' macro, 
% it is actually possible to mix UTF-8 metadata with other bytes;
% provided, of course, you have an editor that allows such a file
% to be created and saved. On the other hand, if you are unhappy with mixing
% content having different encodings, then there is another way, based upon
% \LaTeX's LICR macros~\cite[\S\,7.11]{LC2} for representing accented 
% and non-latin characters. 
% These are normally hidden away (`I $=$ Internal') but in fact can be seen
% within auxiliary files, such as |.aux| and |.toc|, |.lof| and |.lot|.
% This is how \LaTeX\ stores the knowledge of such characters for use in
% a part of the document processing which may not have the same encoding
% as the document as a whole, or may require characters generated using several
% different encodings. Thus LICRs allow for a reliable representation
% passed to a different context; think `I $=$ Interchange'.

% \caption{How to get desired LICRs into the \texttt{.toc} file.}\label{koi8-toc}
% \end{figure}
%
% Figure~\ref{koi8-LICR} shows how to see this. 
% The document source in the lower portion clearly shows the cyrillic
% input, whereas the |.log| messages in a command-line window above
% reveal the LICR representation. A command |\showLICRs| is available
% with |pdfx.sty| version 1.5.8, specifically to allow this.
% Now the LICR representation can be copied directly from the |.log| file, 
% modulo slight difficulties due to the way long lines are broken.
% As this representation is entirely with ASCII characters, it should not
% cause any conflict with any UTF-8 metadata that you want within the same file.
% The |.xmpdata| file might now look as in Figure~\ref{koi8-code2}.
% Although very verbose, this should be resistant to any corruption due to
% character encodings, and produces the same result within the PDF, 
% as in Figure~\ref{koi8-meta}.
% 
% Alternatively one can exploit the |.toc| file, using \LaTeX's command
% |\addtocontents|, as shown in Figure~\ref{koi8-toc}.
% After processing the file, you can copy the LICR representations out
% of the |.toc| file, taking care to remove anything of a non-character
% nature (e.g., implementing the size and spacing of the letters in \TeX).
%
% Of course once you have harvested the metadata in this format, remove
% or comment-out those extra |\showLICRs| to get uninterrupted processing.
% Similarly comment-out the extra |\addtocontents| lines, else the real 
% Table-of-Contents will become corrupted with unwanted entries.
% A couple more \LaTeX\ processing runs should restore the PDF to the
% way you want it.

% \LaTeX's \texttt{T1} encoding \cite[p.\,449]{LC2}.}\label{tldoc-pol}
%\end{figure}
%
% Here the `parser macro' is |\textLII|, which can be seen in Figure~\ref{tldoc-pol}
% to surround either complete metadata entries, or just those parts containing 
% polish accented (or other) characters in entries that also contain english words.
% The macro |\textLF| provides a line-feed character for the UTF-8 output.
%
% As a technical note, the |\jobname.xmpdata| file is read with |\obeyspaces|
% in effect. This causes space runs in the input to be replaced by a single
% `active space' character, which ultimately expands into a normal space upon output.
% This is needed to preserve inter-word spaces, which would otherwise
% get lost during parsing, due to \TeX's pattern matching when reading macro arguments.
% Each byte is examined individually, with normal letters |a-zA-Z| and most punctuation
% characters passed through unchanged.
%
% \medskip\goodbreak
% Let's understand better how this example was created. There are three files involved.
%\begin{itemize}
% \item |pdfx.dtx|, the source for this documentation, open in an editor with
% encoding declared as UTF-8; 
% \item |texlive-pl.tex| the Polish documentation for \TeX\ Live, open in the
% same editor with Latin-2 encoding;
% \item |latin2-example.tex| which starts life as an empty file on disk.
%\end{itemize}
% \noindent
% This latter file must be opened in the editor, with encoding declared as 
% Latin-2 (ISO-8859-2).
% Next the preamble is copied from |texlive-pl.tex| and pasted into |latin2-example.tex|
% which is then saved to disk. Further editing is done to |latin2-example.tex| to
% add verbatim markers (\texttt{$\vert$...$\vert$}) and adjust line lengths for display
% within Figure~\ref{tldoc-pol}. This file's contents is included as part of the 
% documentation via |\input{latin2-example}| within an environment that handles 
% presentation aspects, and (since 2018) declares |\UseRawInputEncoding|.
%
% What \emph{cannot} be done is to paste the preamble content directly into |pdfx.dtx|.
% Consider what would then happen, using `t{\l}umaczy' (`translators', on line 10 
% following `UWAGA'). This word shows correctly in the Latin-2 encoded files. 
% It was typeset here using |\l| for the `\l' letter, having Unicode code-point 
% |Ux0142| (so UTF-8 byte pair |"C5|\,|"82|). 
% However, it occurs at slot |"B3| within Latin-2 encoding. 
% In the |T1| font encoding \cite[p.\,449]{LC2} the character glyph name 
% for slot |"B3| is |/scedilla|, which is what shows in Figure~\ref{tldoc-pol}. 
% When the `\l' is pasted directly into a UTF-8 file and shown verbatim, 
% the result is the pair of glyphs |"C5| (|/Aring|) and |"82| (|/Cacute|); 
% \emph{viz.} {\UseRawInputEncoding |tłumaczy|}.
%
% As with Figure~\ref{koi8-code} it is not important that the correct characters
% are shown here, but that the metadata in |\jobname.xmpdata| corresponds to what
% is used on the titlepage of the PDF; e.g., the contents of |\Title| and |\title|,
% |\Author| and |\author|, etc.

% }\label{greek-code}
%\end{figure}
%
% Prior to proper support for UTF-8 input, a method for preparing document source
% for the modern Greek language (and also for polytonic Greek), involved the use
% of LGR encoded fonts. Such a font has Greek (instead of Latin) letters in the 
% slots for |a-zA-Z|, see~\cite[\S9.4.2]{LC2}. Thus ordinary ASCII letters are used
% to produce the Greek characters; the mapping of ASCII to Greek is referred to as
% a `transliteration' scheme. It serves as \emph{both} an input encoding, and as 
% a font encoding. Accents and diacritic marks are provided through ligatures 
% built-in to the fonts. Various documents can be found on the web\footnote{e.g., 
% \url{http://milde.users.sourceforge.net/LGR/}} and
% within \TeX\ Live distributions\footnote{%
% TeXLive: \textcolor{urlcolor}{\texttt{.../2016/texmf-dist/doc/generic/babel-greek/}}}. 
%
% Indeed the current maintainer G\"unther Milde states
% ``The LGR transliteration does not work for PDF metadata''.
% This is because there is no translation of LGR input into \LaTeX\ LICRs,
% as happens with say |\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}| for UTF-8 input,
% or when upper 8-bit characters are present using |\usepackage[iso-8859-7]{inputenc}|.  
% With these, LICRs such as |\textAlpha|, |\textOmicron|, \dots, |\textomega| 
% are produced, which result in the correct characters for metadata and bookmarks,
% perhaps employing Unicode `combining' characters for accented letters.
% Using |pdfx| the UTF-8 characters can be put directly into the |.xmpdata| file;
% LICRs are interpreted provided the |grkxmp| loading option has been specified.
% 
% Using the methods of |pdfx| the metadata difficulty is remedied, as can be seen in 
% Figure~\ref{greek-meta} using coding as shown in Figure~\ref{greek-code}. This requires 
% the |LGRxmp| option and |\textLGR| `parser' macro. The original document source, 
% called |usage.tex|, can be found in the directory specified in the footnote below.
% As this document is essentially an English description of how to use LGR for Greek,
% we have used the `Keywords' field to provide examples of such usage. 
% Since a macro |\textgreek| can be used for greek portions within such documents, 
% this macro name is aliased to |\textLGR| within the context where metadata is processed.
% Furthermore, parsing using |\textLGR| generates correct pre-composed characters 
% for letters with accents or diacritics. Bookmarks can also be generated from
% LGR input, using a technique described in Section~\ref{sssec-arm}.
%
% \bigskip\noindent
% The features available with different loading options are summarised here.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item 
%  no option: all metadata in |.xmpdata| file is in UTF-8 (incl. ASCII)
% \item
%  |grkxmp|: LICRs can be present; e.g. |\textAlpha|, |\textOmega|, etc. 
% \item
%  |LGRxmp|: supports LGR-encoded input and |ISO-8859-7| upper range characters,
%    using the |\textLGR| `parser' macro.         
% \end{itemize}
% With |LGRxmp| specified, the features of |grkxmp| are also available; so any 
% lower-listed option allows data to be mixed with that for higher-listed ones.
%
%
% The final piece to get validation for PDF/A from LGR input, is to specify
% a Unicode point for the `|v|' used only in the strong `|sv|' ligature to obtain 
% a non-final `sigma' typeset in isolation. 
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\pdfglyphtounicode{internalchar2}{200D}|
%\end{decl}
% This gives an interpretation as `zero-width joiner'.
% There are two instances of this within |usage.tex|. Copy/Paste works as desired.
% Using \pdftex\ the above command is done automatically. 
% Drivers, such as Xe\LaTeX\ lacking an implementation of |\pdfglyphtounicode|, 
% can fail to produce a valid PDF due to this rather minor deficiency.
% 
% Greek numerals, using |\greeknumeral| or |\Greeknumeral| cannot work directly within
% a |.xmpdata| file. However if such is desired, the following technique allows
% correct LICRs to be found for use in the metadata. 
% At any convenient place within the \LaTeX\ source; e.g., near where the required  
% number is used, insert coding such as:
% \begin{decl}[]
% |{\pdfxGreeknumeralsHack \textgreek{\edef\num{\greeknumeral{1997}}\show\num}}%|
% \end{decl}
% Upon processing, the following will be written to the console or |.log|-window.

% 
% The \ArmTeX\ package\footnote{documentation: %

% provides the method to typeset Armenian, with input being specified in various ways

% at the use of the |OT6| encoding, developed for this purpose.
% Each way is supported by |pdfx.sty| with appropriate loading options, similar
% to the support for Greek~(see Section~\ref{sssec-grk}). 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item 
%  no option: all metadata in |.xmpdata| file is in UTF-8 (incl. ASCII)  
% \item
%   |armxmp|: using LICR-like macro names; e.g. |\armAyb|, |\armsha|, |\armfe| etc. 
% \item
%   |AR8xmp|: using the \ArmTeX\ (|OT6|) transliteration scheme or with upper-range
%    characters in |ArmSCII8| encoding, using the `parser' macro |\textARM|.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \goodbreak\noindent
% There are 39 letters in the Armenian alphabet, so the transliteration includes
% many 2-letter combinations to specify the desired character. Whereas Greek uses
% punctuation symbols to specify diacritics, Armenian requires either ligatures
% implemented in the |OT6|-encoded font, or careful parsing of the input into
% LICR-like macros.
% \LaTeX\ source\footnote{TeXLive: %
% \textcolor{urlcolor}{\texttt{.../2016/texmf-dist/doc/generic/armenian/examples/latex/}}} 
% for the \ArmTeX\ documentation is available in both English and Armenian. 
% Figure~\ref{arm-meta} shows the result of enriching the Armenian version with relevant 
%  metadata, using coding as shown in Figure~\ref{arm-code}.
%
% As in earlier examples, that metadata has come from the extensive comments at the head
% of the \LaTeX\ source file (represented by |...| in Figure~\ref{arm-code}), and other
% title-page material, such as title and author names in both English and Armenian.
% Within the keywords are armenian words that are mentioned in the documentation as being
% slightly tricky to represent in transliteration, to verify that the required tricks have
% been correctly implemented.
%
% Also apparent in Figure~\ref{arm-meta} is the use of Armenian letters in the Bookmarks
% pane, having been generated from the transliteration source. This requires a 3-step
% process, as follows.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
%  conversion of transliterated source into UTF-8. 
%  This is done as the |.xmpdata| file is processed, using |\pdfxEnableCommands|
%  to make global definitions; e.g, 
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\xdef\sectAtitle{\textARM{Nerac'uthyun}}|

%  capturing the section title in the form supplied in the \LaTeX\ source.

%  conversion of the UTF-8 representation into |UTF16-be|, suitable for bookmark
%  strings within the PDF file. With \pdftex\ thishis is done using 
%  |\StringEncodingConvert| from Heiko Oberdiek's |stringenc.sty| package.
%  Lua\LaTeX\ and Xe\LaTeX\ can use the UTF-8 representation directly.
% \item
%  integration of the |UTF16-be| string (\pdftex) or UTF-8 string (Lua\TeX\ and Xe\TeX)
%  into the coding that would normally generate the bookmark from a provided section title,
%  in transliterated form.
% \end{enumerate}
% These last two steps are combined into a single command, to replace the usual
% command for a section title; |\section|, |\subsection|, etc.
% \begin{decl}[]
% |\pdfxBookmark{\section}{\sectAtitle}{Nerac'uthyun}|
% \end{decl}
% Now |\pdfxBookmark| first checks that the macro passed as the 2nd argument
% actually exists. If it does not, an error message is given and upon continuation
% would just do |\section{Nerac'uthyun}| as normal. 
% When it does exist, then step 2 is done (by \pdftex) storing the result as |\pdfx@temp|. 
% With Lua\TeX\ and Xe\TeX, |\pdfx@temp| stores a copy of the UTF-8 data.
% Then the commands needing to be executed are essentially
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\pdfstringdefDisableCommands{\let\sectAtitle\pdfx@temp}|\\
% |\def\sectAtitle{Nerac'uthyun}|\\
% |\section{\sectAtitle}|
%\end{decl}
% so that the correct section heading is displayed on the page,
% but when |\sectAtitle| is processed to create a bookmark it is replaced
% by the pre-prepared contents of |\pdfx@temp|.
% There are some technicalities\footnote{In fact a small change is made 
% to how \textcolor{verbcolor}{\texttt{\string\@@writetorep}} is used.} 
% to make this work cleanly, 
% as just doing these commands would interfere with other uses of |\pdfstringdef|.
% In case a long sectioning command has an optional argument, or a $*$-variant
% is needed, then include it this way.

% \subsubsection[Other Languages]{Other Languages}\label{sssec-other}
% 
% There is support for Metadata using characters from other languages,
% with corresponding loading options, as follows. 
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item  |arbxmp| : Arabic; 
% via LICRs |\textarabicalef|, |\textarabicqaf|,\\ |\textarabicaleflowerhamza|, etc.
%  \item  |devxmp| : Devanagari; 
% via LICRs |\textdevanagaria|, |\textdevanagarivocalicr|,\\ |\textdevanagaricandrabindu|, etc.
%  \item  |hebxmp| : Hebrew;
% via LICRs |\hebalef|, |\hebsamekh|, |\hebfinalpe| and accent marks |\segol|, |\qubuts|, etc.
%  \item  |vnmxmp| : Vietnamese; 
% via LICRs |\ABREVE|, |\OCIRCUMFLEX|, |\uhorn| etc. and the combinations of multiple accents
%  applied as usual via |\'|, |\`|, |\^|, etc.
% \end{itemize}
% The LICRs include support mapping accented letters to precomposed glyphs, falling back on
% `combining characters' only in unusual situations. Special input conventions or methods,
% such as transliteration schemes, are \emph{not yet} supported. 
% Indeed, these options are largely untested, so any difficulties encountered should 
% be reported to the package authors. Requests to support extra input methods or other
% language blocks should also be directed to the authors, along with pointers to where
% the desired input methods are fully described. 
% Sample `real-world' documents would be greatly appreciated.
%
%
% \subsection[L8U pseudo-encoding]{L8U pseudo-encoding}\label{ssec-L8U}
%  
% To understand how |pdfx| handles the translation into UTF-8 of input that is not already
% in that format, we'll briefly discuss \LaTeX's font-encoding mechanism, which is the
% basis for LICR macros~\cite[\S\,7.11]{LC2}. As an example, consider the macro |\textgamma|
% representing the lowercase Greek letter $\gamma$.
% Various \LaTeX\ packages declare this as LICR in different ways, for different purposes.
%\begin{decl}[]
% |greek-fontenc/lgrenc.def:\DeclareTextSymbol{\textgamma}{LGR}{103}|\\
% |tipa/t3enc.def:\DeclareTextSymbol\textgamma{T3}{71}             % Gamma|\\
% |greek-fontenc/greek-euenc.def:\DeclareTextCommand{\textgamma}{\LastDeclaredEncoding}{γ}|\\
% |hyperref/puenc.def:\DeclareTextCommand{\textgamma}{PU}{\83\263}%* U+03B3|\\
% |ucs/data/uni-2.def:\uc@dclc{611}{tipa}{\textgamma}%|\\
% |ucs/data/uni-3.def:\uc@dclc{947}{default}{\textgamma}%|
% \end{decl}
% Here the |\uc@dclc| commands associate UTF-8 input of |Ux0263| (IPA small letter gamma)
% and |Ux03B3| (Greek small letter gamma) internally with |\textgamma|, 
% whereas the others deal with output formats\footnote{Whereas {\color{verbcolor}\texttt{ucs.sty}}
% handles UTF-8 input, mapping it to LICRs, with {\color{verbcolor}\texttt{pdfx.sty}} 
% we need the reverse mapping into UTF-8, not just from LICRs but also from legacy
% 8-bit encodings and transliteration schemes.}. 
% In four of these examples there is a number, which refers to a position in an `encoding vector' 
% for the particular font used to place the character onto the printable page.
% For example |LGR| refers to greek fonts, encoded as explained in Section~\ref{sssec-grk}.
% IPA phonetics use the |T3| encoding, so |\textgamma| refers to a character
% from a different Unicode block.
%
% With two of these cases there is no specific font.
% For example, |PU| is used to create bookmark strings, 
% and other PDF string inclusions, using |\pdfstringdef| from the |hyperref| package. 
% With |greek-euenc.def| designed for Xe\TeX\ and Lua\TeX, the encoding can be variable, 
% with the output bytes being those for the UTF-8 encoding of $\gamma$, namely |^^ce^^b3|, 
% shown here as the |T1|-encoded pair |γ|. 
% The term `pseudo-encoding' has been coined by the \LaTeX\ team. 
% Although there is no actual font to determine the encoding, to an author there is essentially 
% no difference in how corresponding macros can be used to get a character placed into 
% an appropriate structure within the PDF. 
%
% Thus there are 4 output forms for this character,
% and we've not even considered how $\gamma$ is used in mathematics!
% To handle these concurrently, one has internally-defined control-sequence names
% \begin{decl}[] 
%  |\LGR\textgamma=\char"67| \qquad where $6\times 16 + 7 = 103$\\
%  |\T3\textgamma=\char"47| \qquad where $4\times 16 + 7 = 71$\\
%  |\PU\textgamma=\long macro:->\83\263|\\
%  |\L8U\textgamma=\long macro:->γ|
% \end{decl}
% where the 2nd `\textbackslash' is part of the name\footnote{%
% obtained using {\color{verbcolor}%
% \texttt{\string\csname\space LGR\string\string\string\textgamma\string\endcsname}}.}. 
% The latter macro is explained below.
% To use the specific version of the macro, \LaTeX\ maintains a `font-encoding'
% parameter, set using |\fontencoding{...}| local to the surrounding environment grouping.
%
% To the above declarations of |\textgamma|, to deal with conversion to UTF-8, 
% the |pdfx| package adds the following declarations when the |LGRxmp| option is used.
% \begin{decl}[]
% |pdfx/l8ugrk.def:\DeclareTextCommand{\textgamma}{L8U}{γ}|\\
% |pdfx/l8ugrk.def:\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\textLGRenc}{L8U}{\textgamma}{γ}|\\
% |pdfx/l8ugrk.def:\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\textLGRenc}{L8U}{g}{γ} |\\
% |pdfx/l8ugrk.def:\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\textLGRenc}{L8U}{^^e3}{γ}|
% \end{decl}
% The pseudo-encoding name |L8U| indicates \textbf{L}ocal conversion into UTF-\textbf{8} \textbf{U}nicode, 
% as required for metadata, using |pdfx.sty|. Currently this pseudo-encoding is used in one place only; 
% during the interpretation of information supplied through the |\jobname.xmpdata| file.
% This happens as part of the |pdfx| package, \emph{before} it uses |xmpincl.sty|.
% Such specificity justifies being called a `Local' encoding. 
% However, other tasks may emerge requiring on-the-fly conversion to UTF-8.
% In this case all the functionality of this pseudo-encoding could be shifted into a separate package,
% and the name changed to reflect this more general usage.
% Bookmarks from transliterated input, as described in Section~\ref{sssec-arm},
% is possibly a sufficient reason to have a separate package. Another possibility is to
% generate on-the-fly creation of UTF-8 strings, to be sent to Xe\TeX\ or Lua\TeX\ running
% as a slave process to generate images of string using OTF fonts, which \pdftex\ currently
% cannot handle. The result would then be imported back into the running job as an image. 
% The authors invite suggestions of how this |L8U| pseudo-encoding functionality can be put to
% good use.
%
%  \goodbreak
% Accented letters normally use (e.g., from |t1enc.def|)
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\DeclareTextComposite{\`}{T1}{A}{192}|
%\end{decl}
% to get the pre-composed `\`A', rather than a composite built from \`{} and `A'.
% The last parameter is an index into a font; however the |\DeclareTextCompositeCommand| 
% variant allows arbitrary coding as that final parameter, so can be the bytes for the
% UTF-8 representation of a character.
% In the above code lines, macros are defined as follows
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\\L8U\textLGRenc-\textgamma=macro:->γ|\\
% |\\L8U\textLGRenc-g=macro:->γ|\\
% |\\L8U\textLGRenc-|{\color{verbcolor}\texttt{\~a}}|=macro:->γ|
%\end{decl}
% where now the 2nd and 3rd (and perhaps 4th) `\textbackslash' are part of the name\footnote{%
% obtained using {\color{verbcolor}%
% \texttt{\string\csname\string\string\string\LGR\string\string\string\textLGRenc-\string\string\string\textgamma\string\endcsname}}.}.
% This shows how the ascii letter `g' is associated with the UTF-8 bytes for $\gamma$,
% and how the upper 8-bit character from |^^e3| can be similarly associated,
% as in |ISO-8859-7| encoding.
%
% All these associations come together in the `parser' macro |\textLGR| which works as follows.
% Firstly, |\textLGR| is declared for |L8U| pseudo-encoding only, where it expands as follows.
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\L8U\textLGR #1->\textgreekLGRstring {#1}|\\
% |\L8U\textgreekLGRstring #1->\textgreekLGR@ii #1\@empty \@empty|\\
% |\textgreekLGR@ii #1#2\@empty -> ... |  coding to test what is in |#2|\\
% | ...  \textLGRenc{#1}\@empty | \quad if |#2| is |\@empty|\\
% | ...  \textLGRenc{#1}\textgreekLGR@i #2\@empty | \quad if |#2| has more tokens\\
% |\textgreekLGR@i #1->\textgreekLGR@ii #1|
%\end{decl}
% Thus |\textLGRenc| is called on each token in the argument of |\textLGR|. 
% Now |\textLGRenc|, which is applicable only when |L8U| pseudo-encoding is in effect,
% has a default expansion of just passing the character through unchanged; \emph{viz.}
%\begin{decl}[]
% |\DeclareTextCommand{\textLGRenc}{L8U}[1]{#1}|
%\end{decl}
% but by using |\DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\textLGRenc}{L8U}{...}{...}|,
% alternate expansions apply with specific arguments, as shown above. 
% In particular, that final argument can include coding that `looks ahead' to find the next
% character. This is used, for example, with diacritics in Greek, multi-letter sequences
% for Armenian letters, and other special cases related to ligatures and punctuation symbols.
% To illustrate this Figure~\ref{ex-arm} (below) follows the conversion of a specific word, 
% given in the transliteration for Armenian~(see Section~\ref{sssec-arm}).
% This conversion occurs using only \TeX's macro-expansion ability.
% Some details relevant to this example are explained there.

% The macro |\armen@en| (named for \textbf{e}mpty or \textbf{n}ext),
% looks ahead to see if the 5th-next argument token is |\@empty|,

% (A closed bracing |{...}| counts as a single argument.) If |\@empty| the tokens in 
% the 2nd bracing are substituted, otherwise those in the 3rd bracing.
% Similarly |\armen@nc| (named for \textbf{n}ext \textbf{c}haracter) 
% looks to see whether that 5th argument token matches with the character in the
% 1st bracing. If so, the 2nd bracing's tokens are substituted, else those of the 3rd bracing.
% This is how to cope with `Sh' or `SH', implemented as ligatures in an |OT6| encoded font, 
% denoting a different letter from a single `S'. The macro |\armuh| is used here 
% to \emph{prevent} a ligature from |ev| that would otherwise occur.
% One writes |e\armuh v| to get the separate letters. As the space becomes an active token, 
% we need |\textarmgobblespace| to restart parsing appropriately. 
% Of course |\textarmenARM@i| behaves like |\textgreekLGR@i| 
% as explained earlier, with a test for |\@empty| as the 2nd token. 
% At the end, any remaining |\@empty| expand into nothing.

% Such `nested parsing' seems to be quite robust\footnote{%

%\end{figure}
% When preparing such documents \LaTeX's |\providecommand| is used to supply default values,
% not drawn from the database; but when actually used, these are ignored as the required
% information has been supplied using \TeX's |\def| command.
% The resulting metadata is as in Figure~\ref{wflow-meta}, showing also how the information
% is displayed at the top of the PDF file that is produced.
% Notice how a command |\utext| is included to obtain the underlining of the surname within
% the produced PDF. This is modified, using |\pdfxEnableCommands| in the |\jobname.xmpdata|
% file, to just place a comma after the surname in the metadata, as it precedes the given name.
%
%\newpage\noindent
% Another way that jobs can be customised using essentially the same \LaTeX\ source,
% is via the command used to initiate the job. For example the file |sample.tex|,
% accompanying the |pdfx| distribution, can be used to test the loading options to create
% PDFs conforming to the various flavours of PDF/A, PDF/E and PDF/X. 
% Consider a shell script containing the following (Unix/Linux) commands.
%\begin{decl}[]
% |pdflatex "\def\pdfxopt{a-2b}\input sample.tex"|\\
% |pdflatex "\def\pdfxopt{a-2b}\input sample.tex"|\\
% |mv sample.pdf sample-a2b.pdf|\\
% ||\\
% |pdflatex "\def\pdfxopt{a-2u}\input sample.tex"|\\
% |pdflatex "\def\pdfxopt{a-2u}\input sample.tex"|\\
% |mv sample.pdf sample-a2u.pdf|\\
% |...|
%\end{decl}
% With a 3-line block for each flavour, this produces a corresponding PDF
% from the same \LaTeX\ source, named according to each particular variant.
% A default |\providecommand{\pdfxopt}{a-1b}| at the start of |sample.tex| catches the case
% of normal typesetting, doing nothing when |\pdfxopt| already has an expansion value.

% \subsection[Further Developments]{Further Developments}\label{ssec-further}
%
% Prospects for further development of the |pdfx| package are as follows, 
% listed not necessarily in order of perceived importance.
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    Support for the |dvips| driver with Ghostscript as PDF producer; possible since |gs v9.21|.
%  \item
%    Separate the |L8U| pseudo-encoding support into a separate package.
%  \item
%    Conformance to multiple PDF standards; e.g. both PDF/A and PDF/E,
%     both PDF/A and PDF/X with RGB or CMYK color profile, other combinations.
%  \item
%    Explore delaying the processing of metadata until |\begin{document}|, 
%    thereby allowing some fields to be set automatically from other information
%    supplied within the document preamble.
%  \item
%    Support for input using other legacy 8-bit encodings and transliterations.
%  \item
%    Support for more mathematical environments within the metadata.
%  \item
%    Support for more PRISM metadata fields, incl. PRISM 3.0~\cite{PRISM}.
%  \item
%    Explore ways to overcome incompatibilities that may arise with other packages.
%  \item
%    Full support for PDF/VT; in particular, transparency groups and PDF/VT-2s.
%  \item
%    Support for more aspects of PDF/UA and `Tagged PDF'.
%  \item
%    Develop ways to usefully use |L8U| apart from metadata and bookmarks.
%  \item
%   Support emerging standards based on PDF 2.0~\cite{PDF20}.
% \end{itemize}

%% Convert the relevant XMP properties to PDF strings, expanding markup

%% This is not always enough — a driver may add it by default!
